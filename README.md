Sudoku Solver:
This code solves Sudoku puzzles using the backtracking algorithm. The code first checks if a given number can be placed in a specific cell without violating the Sudoku rules. If it can, the number is placed in the cell, and the recursive function is called to solve the rest of the puzzle. If no number can be placed in the cell, the function backtracks and tries another number.

Usage:
To use the code, simply compile it and run the executable. The code will print the unsolved Sudoku puzzle, and then it will print the solved Sudoku puzzle if it finds a solution. If no solution is found, the code will print a message saying so.

Code Explanation:
The code is divided into four main parts:

1. isValid(): This function checks if a given number can be placed in a specific cell without violating the Sudoku rules.

2. solveSudoku(): This function solves the Sudoku puzzle using the backtracking algorithm.

3. printBoard(): This function prints the Sudoku puzzle to the console.

4. main(): This function is the main entry point of the program. It reads the Sudoku puzzle from a hardcoded array, and then it calls the solveSudoku() function to solve the puzzle.

Running the Code:
To run the code, you will need a C++ compiler. Once you have a compiler, you can compile the code using the following command:

g++ sudoku_solver.cpp -o sudoku_solver
This will create an executable file called sudoku_solver. To run the code, you can type the following command:

./sudoku_solver
This will print the unsolved Sudoku puzzle, and then it will print the solved Sudoku puzzle if it finds a solution. If no solution is found, the code will print a message saying so.
